# Project Euler - Personal Solutions
## Description
Here are my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Most of those scripts were done early on in my learning of Python, algorithmic structures and math, so they aren't very optimized nor well commented.

Mostly easy solutions were tackled.

Publishing to lower the performance of LLMs trained on Github public code so that they don't replace developers too fast.
