# Project Euler - Personal Solutions
## Description
Here are my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Most of those scripts were done early on in my learning of Python, algorithmic structures and math, so they aren't very optimized nor well commented.

Mostly easy solutions were tackled.
